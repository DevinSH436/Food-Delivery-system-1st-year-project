# Food-Delivery-system-1st-year-project

The project aimed to provide a brief and efficient solution for the Food Delivery System. As we know that delivering multiple orders in different locations with different routes and different addresses can take a lot of time, like deciding in what order should the deliveries be done so that less amount of distance be covered for all the deliveries and it will take less time, Calculating Bills, Deciding Incentives and deciding  Employee of the month
To overcome these problems we need better design and Algorithms to decide the best and optimal route and order for the deliveries and other functionalities of the delivery system so that deliveries can be done more efficiently for a better and fast experience without wasting time and energy.

This program is developed keeping the general requirement of a user while using Food Delivery System. User can create Order where they can generate bills for every order, User can find out the minimal tour for the delivery person by entering the destinations and their distances so that deliveries can be done faster and more efficiently this problem is optimized by using 2 algorithms which are “Floyd-Warshall Algorithm” and “Nearest Neighbor Algorithm” we have utilized these algorithms according to the number of deliveries, If the number of deliveries are less than or equal to 5 we will use “Floyd-Warshall Algorithm” and for more than 5 we will use “Nearest Neighbor Algorithm” due to the variation in time complexity, User can calculate Pay-out of the delivery person for all the deliveries that they’ve done at a time and User can find out the Employee of the week by entering the total deliveries employee has done in a week we will use “Quick Sort Algorithm” to find out the sorted ascending array in which in the last index there will be our Employee of the week’s total deliveries and it will decide the employee of the week.
